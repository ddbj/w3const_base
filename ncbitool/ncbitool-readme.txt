Put the 'ncbitool.tar.gz' file which compresses binaries with large file size, in the local ncbitool directory if you want to include the binaries to the container. Do not upload the ncbi binaries or big files to the w3const_base repository.

Example, ncbitool.tar.gz file contains
./splign
./vecscreen
